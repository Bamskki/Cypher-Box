/**
 * "It may already have gone through."
 *
 * Every call that hands a transaction to the ASP or to the chain shares one
 * hazard: if the connection dies mid-call, we cannot tell whether it landed.
 * Reporting that as a failure is a guess, and the copy that follows a guess is
 * usually a lie. `ArkSendReviewScreen` said, verbatim, "Your funds were not
 * moved"; the exit-fee sheet said "Your Ark funds are unchanged".
 *
 * Both can be false, and a user who is told their money is untouched while it
 * is confirming goes looking for a balance that has legitimately gone.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN ITS OWN MODULE
 *
 * The first version of this guard sat inside `executeArkSend`, which covered
 * the two call sites the bug was reported against and none of the four others:
 * `exitFunding.convertToExitFees`, `offboard.offboardArkVtxos`,
 * `exit.claimArkExitsToAddress`, and `recoverOnchainBoard`. Fixing a path
 * rather than a capability leaves the next call site to reintroduce it.
 *
 * CALL SITES. Keep this list current; an audit found the Lightning ones missing
 * from it, and the list being wrong is part of why they stayed unguarded. Six
 * sites were enumerated here, all of them arkoor, on-chain or exit paths, so
 * "the Lightning branch is not on the list" never looked like an omission.
 *
 *   exit.ts                 claimArkExitsToAddress
 *   exitFunding.ts          convertToExitFees
 *   recoverOnchainBoard.ts  recoverArkOnchainBoard
 *   offboard.ts             offboardArkVtxos
 *   send.ts                 sendArkoorPayment
 *   send.ts                 sendOnchain
 *   send.ts                 dispatchLnSend          <- added 2026-09-08
 *
 * `lightning.ts#cancelArkLightningReceive` uses `looksLikeConnectionLoss`
 * directly rather than this wrapper, because it returns a discriminated result
 * instead of throwing. Same rule, different shape.
 *
 * The test to apply when adding a call: does it hand something to the ASP or
 * the chain that could still land after the connection dies? If yes, it belongs
 * here, and it belongs on this list.
 *
 * It imports nothing from the SDK on purpose, so any module can wrap a call
 * without dragging the native binding into a unit test.
