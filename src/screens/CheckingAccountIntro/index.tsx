This entity will help you send and receive payments globally, instantaneously, with ~zero fees. You can also use it to accumulate a measured amount of bitcoin until you are able to economically withdraw to self-custody.

                      Be careful: while bitcoin custodians and exchanges offer user friendly financial services, it's wise to exercise caution with the amount of money you entrust to them. As your balance increases, Cypher Box will notify you and provide instructions on how to secure your wealth independently, without the reliance on any third party custodian.
